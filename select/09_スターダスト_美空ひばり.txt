And now the purple dust of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky, the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder Why I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song. the melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago, now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms, the nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Tho'I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of love's refrain
